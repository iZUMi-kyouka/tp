## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F09-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar TalentNexus.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Redoing undone operations: `redo`

Redoes operations that were undone recently.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warning:** If you have undone some operations, and you perform operations that modify any recruit, you will not be able to redo these undone operations anymore.
</box>

Format: `redo`

Examples usage scenario:
1. You delete recruit Li.

### Locating recruits by name: `find`

Finds and lists all recruits whose details match any of the given keywords. The search is **case-insensitive** and can be filtered by different fields using flags.

If no flag is provided, the command searches by **name** by default.
If both default keyword(s) and name keyword(s) are specified, the **name keyword(s)** will take precedence.

* `FLAG` specifies the field(s) to search under:
    * `-id` — Search by Recruit ID
    * `-n` — Search by Name
    * `-p` — Search by Phone
    * `-e` — Search by Email
    * `-a` — Search by Address
    * `-t` — Search by Tag

* `KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...` are one or more search terms.
  Multiple keywords can be separated by the pipe symbol (`|`).

If multiple flags are provided, the results will include recruits who satisfy all search criteria

---

**Shorthand formats:**
* `find alice` — Finds recruits whose name contains “alice” (case-insensitive)
* `find -n alice|bob|charlie` — Finds recruits whose name contains **“alice”**, **“bob”**, or **“charlie”**
* `find -a Clementi|Tampines` — Finds recruits whose address contains **“Clementi”** or **“Tampines”**

### Sorting recruits : `sort`

Sorts all recruits in the address book by specified fields in ascending or descending order.

* `ORDER` can be either `asc` (ascending) or `desc` (descending).
* Multiple fields can be specified, and they will be applied in order of priority from left to right.
* If no parameters are provided, recruits will be sorted by name in ascending order by default.
* If only `asc` or `desc` is provided (without field prefixes), recruits will be sorted by name in that order.
* The sort is case-insensitive for text fields (name, email, address).

**Shorthand formats:**
* `sort` - Sorts by name in ascending order
* `sort asc` - Sorts by name in ascending order
* `sort desc` - Sorts by name in descending order

Examples:
* `sort` - Sorts all recruits by name in ascending order (A to Z)
* `sort desc` - Sorts all recruits by name in descending order (Z to A)
* `sort n/ asc` - Sorts all recruits by name in ascending order
* `sort p/ desc` - Sorts all recruits by phone number in descending order
* `sort n/ asc p/ desc` - Sorts by name (ascending) first, then by phone number (descending) for recruits with the same name
* `sort e/ asc a/ desc` - Sorts by email (ascending) first, then by address (descending) for recruits with the same email

**What is archiving?**
* Archived recruits are hidden from the default [**`list`**](#listing-all-recruits--list) view but remain in the system
* Use this feature to organize inactive or past recruits without deleting their data
* View archived recruits using `list -archive` or `list -all`

**Examples:**
* `list` followed by `archive 2` archives the 2nd recruit in the address book
* `find John` followed by `archive 1` archives the 1st recruit in the results of the `find` command

<box type="info" seamless>

**Tip:** Archive recruits you no longer actively work with to keep your main list clean and focused!

Examples:
*  `export` Exports all recruits to the default filepath found in preferences.json.
*  `export ./data/recruits.csv` Exports all recruits to the relative filepath `./data/recruits.csv`.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Use CSV exports to share data easily between users, or to view it in a spreadsheet software like Excel.
</box>

### Saving the data

TalentNexus data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

TalentNexus data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warning:**
* If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, TalentNexus will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is **strongly recommended** to take a backup of the file before editing it.
* Furthermore, certain edits can cause TalentNexus to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range).
* Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
  </box>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

---

**Q:** Can I use TalentNexus without an internet connection?  
**A:** Yes. TalentNexus is a fully offline desktop application — no internet connection is required for any of its features.

---

**Q:** What happens if I accidentally delete a recruit?  
**A:** You can restore deleted recruits immediately using the `undo` command (`undo`), as long as you haven’t closed the application since the deletion.

---

**Q:** How do I back up my data?  
**A:** Copy the `addressbook.json` file located in the `/data` folder (in the same directory as the `.jar` file). Store this backup in a safe place (cloud storage, external drive, etc.).

---

**Q:** Can I import data from another AddressBook or TalentNexus installation?  
**A:** Yes. Copy the `addressbook.json` file from the other installation into your current `/data` folder, replacing the existing file. **Always back up** your current `addressbook.json` first.

---

**Q:** Why are my changes not appearing after restarting the app?  
**A:** This can happen if the app is executed from a different directory or the data file path has changed. Make sure the `addressbook.json` file is in the `/data` folder relative to the `.jar` file you run.

---

**Q:** What if I enter invalid data directly into the JSON file?  
**A:** TalentNexus validates the data file on startup. If the file format is invalid, the app may reset the data file to an empty state. Always back up the file before making manual edits.

---

**Q:** How do I view archived recruits?  
**A:** Use `list -archive` to show only archived recruits, or `list -all` to view both archived and active recruits.

---

**Q:** What should I do if a command doesn’t work?  
**A:** Check your command syntax against the [**Command summary**](#command-summary) and the relevant command section. You can also run `help` to view the quick command guide.

---

**Q:** How do I reset the application to its default state?  
**A:** Delete both `preferences.json` and `addressbook.json` from the data directory. On next launch the app will recreate default files and sample data.

---

**Q:** How do I run TalentNexus with a specific Java version?  
**A:** Ensure the desired JDK is installed and on your `PATH`. Run the app with that Java binary, e.g.:

**Q:** Where can I find the JSON schema or data format?  
**A:** The primary data file is `addressbook.json` and stores recruits as JSON objects with fields such as `name`, `phone`, `email`, `address`, `tags`, `archived`, and `uuid`. If you plan to edit the file manually, back it up first and ensure you preserve valid JSON and expected field types (arrays for multiple values like `email`/`phone`/`name`).

---

**Q:** The Help window opened off-screen or is minimized — what do I do?  
**A:** Close the app and delete `preferences.json` in the data directory to reset window positions. Relaunch the app to restore windows to default locations.

---

**Q:** Is there a limit to how many operations I can undo?  
**A:** You can perform up to 200 consecutive `undo` operations. Note that certain actions (like closing the app) may clear the undo history.

---

**Q:** Who do I contact for bug reports or feature requests?  
**A:** Create an issue on the project repository (if using the upstream AddressBook/TalentNexus repo). Include reproducible steps, the `preferences.json` and `addressbook.json` (sanitized if needed), and the Java version used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
