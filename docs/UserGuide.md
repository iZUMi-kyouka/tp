# TalentNexus User Guide

TalentNexus is a **desktop app for managing recruits, optimized for use via a  Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TalentNexus can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar talentnexus.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * [`help`](#viewing-help--help) : Shows help information.

   * [`list`](#listing-all-recruits--list) : Lists all recruits.

   * [`add`](#adding-a-recruit-add) `n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a recruit named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * [`view`](#viewing-a-recruit--view) `2` : Views the 2nd recruit in the address book.

   * [`edit`](#editing-a-recruit--edit) `1 p/91234567` : Edits the phone number of the 1st recruit.

   * [`find`](#locating-recruits-by-name-find) `John` : Finds recruits with "John" in their name.

   * [`sort`](#sorting-recruits--sort) : Sorts recruits by name in ascending order.

   * [`archive`](#archiving-a-recruit--archive) `2` : Archives the 2nd recruit.

   * [`unarchive`](#unarchiving-a-recruit--unarchive) `1` : Unarchives the 1st recruit.

   * [`delete`](#deleting-a-recruit--delete) `3` : Deletes the 3rd recruit shown in the current list.

   * [`export`](#exporting-data--export) : Exports all recruits to a CSV file.

   * [`clear`](#clearing-all-entries--clear) : Deletes all recruits.

   * [`exit`](#exiting-the-program--exit) : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

If both default keyword(s) and name keyword(s) are specified, the **name keyword(s)** will take precedence.

* `FLAG` specifies the field(s) to search under:
    * `-id` — Search by Recruit ID
    * `-n` — Search by Name
    * `-p` — Search by Phone
    * `-e` — Search by Email
    * `-a` — Search by Address
    * `-t` — Search by Tag

* `KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...` are one or more search terms.  
  Multiple keywords can be separated by the pipe symbol (`|`).

If multiple flags are provided, the results will include recruits who satisfy all search criteria

**Shorthand formats:**
* `find alice` — Finds recruits whose name contains “alice” (case-insensitive)
* `find -n alice|bob|charlie` — Finds recruits whose name contains **“alice”**, **“bob”**, or **“charlie”**

### Sorting recruits : `sort`

Sorts all recruits in the address book by specified fields in ascending or descending order.


* `ORDER` can be either `asc` (ascending) or `desc` (descending).
* Multiple fields can be specified, and they will be applied in order of priority from left to right.
* If no parameters are provided, recruits will be sorted by name in ascending order by default.
* If only `asc` or `desc` is provided (without field prefixes), recruits will be sorted by name in that order.
* The sort is case-insensitive for text fields (name, email, address).

**Shorthand formats:**
* `sort` - Sorts by name in ascending order
* `sort asc` - Sorts by name in ascending order
* `sort desc` - Sorts by name in descending order

Examples:
* `sort` - Sorts all recruits by name in ascending order (A to Z)
* `sort desc` - Sorts all recruits by name in descending order (Z to A)
* `sort n/ asc` - Sorts all recruits by name in ascending order
* `sort p/ desc` - Sorts all recruits by phone number in descending order
* `sort n/ asc p/ desc` - Sorts by name (ascending) first, then by phone number (descending) for recruits with the same name
* `sort e/ asc a/ desc` - Sorts by email (ascending) first, then by address (descending) for recruits with the same email

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Use multiple sort criteria to organize your recruits more precisely. The leftmost field has the highest priority.
</box>

**What is archiving?**
* Archived recruits are hidden from the default `list` view but remain in the system
* Use this feature to organize inactive or past recruits without deleting their data
* View archived recruits using `list -archive` or `list -all`

**Examples:**
* `list` followed by `archive 2` archives the 2nd recruit in the address book
* `find John` followed by `archive 1` archives the 1st recruit in the results of the `find` command

<box type="info" seamless>

**Tip:** Archive recruits you no longer actively work with to keep your main list clean and focused!
</box>

### Unarchiving a recruit : `unarchive`

* `list -all` followed by `unarchive 3` unarchives the 3rd recruit if they are archived

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** To unarchive a recruit, first use `list -archive` to view your archived recruits, then use `unarchive INDEX`.
</box>

### Viewing archived recruits

You can view archived recruits using the `list` command with flags:

**Formats:**
* `list` — Shows only unarchived (active) recruits (default)
* `list -archive` — Shows only archived recruits

Examples:
*  `export` Exports all recruits to the default filepath found in preferences.json.
*  `export ./data/recruits.csv` Exports all recruits to the relative filepath ./data/recruits.csv.

**Tip:** Use CSV exports to share data easily between users.

### Saving the data

TalentNexus data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

TalentNexus data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**⚠️ Caution:**
* If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, TalentNexus will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is **strongly recommended** to take a backup of the file before editing it.
* Furthermore, certain edits can cause TalentNexus to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range).
* Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
